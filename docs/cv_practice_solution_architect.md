Nguyen Minh Nam (Mr Nam)  
Solution Architect — Core Banking Modernisation & Payment Platforms  
Hanoi, Vietnam | namnmhp89@gmail.com | +84 90 292 3096 | LinkedIn available on request

## Profile Summary
- 13+ years designing and shipping mission-critical banking solutions, blending Spring Boot/Kafka microservices with Oracle Tuxedo + Pro*C ledgers while safeguarding ACID integrity.
- Lead Solution Architect guiding hybrid roadmaps, regulatory compliance (SBV, PCI DSS, ISO 27001), and vendor governance to sustain 99.97% SLA with <15-minute MTTR.
- Trusted advisor to business and technology leadership: translate product vision into executable architecture, run design reviews, mentor squads across Java, C++/Pro*C, and data engineering.

## Value Proposition
1. **Hybrid Core Transformation:** Preserve “lindy” Tuxedo cores while adding adaptive edge services (Spring Boot orchestrator, Kafka streaming, Landing Zone/DWH) for new digital products.
2. **Operational Excellence:** Embed observability, DevSecOps, and IaC practices to harden uptime, accelerate release cycles, and maintain audit readiness.
3. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Establish event streaming, reconciliation, and analytics pipelines delivering T+0 insights for risk, compliance, and customer operations.

## Impact Highlights
- Delivered CoreBank payment modernisation without downtime: Channels → API Gateway → Spring Boot orchestrator → Tuxedo adapters → Oracle RAC, plus Kafka/Flink analytics; 40+ APIs launched with 70% faster service onboarding.
- Doubled throughput to 3,600 TPS while cutting P95 latency by 460 ms via load-balanced orchestrators, optimized Pro*C routines, and tuned `/Q` queues.
- Instituted CI/CD (GitLab, ArgoCD), IaC (Terraform, Ansible), and observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, OpenTelemetry) covering Java, C++, and Tuxedo components; achieved zero Sev-1 incidents across three quarters.
- Drove hybrid AWS adoption (EKS + on-prem Tuxedo) with secure connectivity, IAM guardrails, and cost controls meeting SBV compliance.

## Core Competencies
- **Architecture & Governance:** Target-state blueprinting, capability roadmaps, TOGAF-inspired review boards, risk assessment, stakeholder alignment.
- **Platform Engineering:** Java/Spring Boot orchestrators, Tuxedo (ATMI/Jolt) integration, transactional outbox + CDC, API Gateway, ESB, rule engines.
- **Data & Streaming:** Kafka, Kafka Streams/Flink, schema management, Landing Zone, DWH/Mart design, near-real-time reconciliation dashboards.
- **Reliability & Security:** Resilience patterns (bulkhead, circuit breaker), chaos/DR drills, SLA/SLO governance, tokenisation, mTLS, Vault/KMS, PCI DSS/ISO 27001 controls.
- **Delivery Leadership:** Agile cadence orchestration, cross-functional squad mentoring, vendor/partner management, incident management and RCAs.

- Implement DevSecOps guardrails: GitLab CI, ArgoCD GitOps, Terraform/Ansible provisioning, automated contract/performance tests, and hardened secrets via Vault.
- Chair architecture review boards, enforce security baselines, and run guild sessions on clean architecture, resilience, and observability patterns.
- Lead chaos tests, DR simulations, and incident postmortems to uphold 99.97% availability and <15-minute MTTR.

### HiPT JSC — Senior Software Engineer / Solution Lead (2014 – 2022)
- Engineered distributed two-phase commit payment services, reducing lock contention 40% and improving P95 latency 25% with optimized pooling, batching, and SQL hints.
- Wrapped Pro*C workloads behind REST/gRPC APIs, ISO 20022/8583 gateways, and ESB integrations (Oracle Service Bus, MuleSoft) supporting Temenos T24, treasury, and card systems.
- Designed SMS Gateway for VNTA MNP project with high-availability SMPP cluster, throttling, and audit logging compliant with telecom regulations.
- Authored API gateway blueprint for national e-government & price data platforms: enforced OAuth2 federation, schema validation, and rate limiting for provincial clients.
- Automated Oracle Tuxedo domain builds/deployments, standardized monitoring/alerting patterns, and enabled multi-language CI/CD pipelines.

### FPT Software — Software Engineer (2012 – 2014)
- Delivered middleware for Android IPTV set-top boxes, optimizing networking stack, memory footprint, and hardening security/logging modules.

## Selected Architecture Engagements
- **CoreBank Tuxedo Payment Modernisation:** Layered architecture (channels → gateway → orchestrator → adapters → Tuxedo → Oracle) plus Kafka streaming, stream processors, and Landing Zone analytics (`docs/corebank_tuxedo_payment_solution.md`).
- **Hybrid AWS Landing Zone:** EKS control plane for Spring Boot/Kafka workloads, secure peering to on-prem Tuxedo, IAM guardrails, and cost observability.
- **Digital Lending Acceleration:** Decision microservices + rule engine (Drools) integrating Core T24, credit scoring, document management; delivered same-day approval journey.
- **Partner Ecosystem APIs:** Idempotency cache, async Kafka flows, circuit breakers boosting partner transaction volume 25% while maintaining SLA.
