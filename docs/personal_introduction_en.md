# Personal Introduction

Hello, I'm **Nguyễn Minh Nam**, a solution architect specializing in core banking payments with more than 12 years of experience across Java, Spring Boot, and Oracle ecosystems. I currently lead the CoreBank Payment Lab—a sandbox that blends modern microservices with the Oracle Tuxedo landscape so product squads can innovate without touching production.

My strengths include:
- Designing end-to-end architectures that deliver real-time payment performance, reliability, and regulatory compliance.
- Modernizing legacy Pro*C/Tuxedo workloads into event-driven Spring Boot services backed by Kafka, the outbox pattern, and well-tested HA/DR strategies.
- Establishing observability standards, security controls, and DevOps pipelines that enable cross-functional teams to ship faster with confidence.

Recent highlights:
- Implemented the outbox→Kafka pipeline and JVM/Oracle tuning that keep SLA below 2 seconds during peak payment traffic.
- Built monitoring dashboards and alerting that reduced incident mean-time-to-repair by 40%.
- Ran resiliency workshops and mentored engineers on fault-tolerant patterns, expanding the lab’s technical maturity.

Beyond delivery work, I enjoy reading about technology strategy, contributing to the Vietnamese Java community, and writing about integration lessons from the banking sector. I'm aiming for a Principal Architect role where I can align technical initiatives with business outcomes and guide the bank’s digital transformation journey sustainably.
